<h2>Jiale Lao</h2>

<p>My name is Jiale Lao, and I'm an undergraduate at Sichuan University. I'm passionate about advanced techniques in Databases, Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and Graph Neural Networks.</p>

<p>I'm fortunate to be mentored by <a href="http://merlintang.github.io/">Prof. Mingjie Tang</a> from Sichuan University and <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/csjgwang/">Prof. Jianguo Wang</a> from Purdue University. Their expertise has enriched my academic experience, balancing theory with hands-on application.</p>

<p>I'm eager to collaborate with others in my fields of interest. Please explore my work, share your feedback, or reach out!</p>
