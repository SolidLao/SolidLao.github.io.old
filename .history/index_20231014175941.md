## Jiale Lao

My name is Jiale Lao, and I'm an undergraduate at Sichuan University. I'm passionate about advanced techniques in databases, machine learning, large language models, and graph neural networks.

I'm fortunate to be mentored by Prof. Mingjie Tang from Sichuan University and Prof. Jianguo Wang from Purdue University. Their expertise has enriched my academic experience, balancing theory with hands-on application.

I'm eager to collaborate with others in my fields of interest. Please explore my work, share your feedback, or reach out!
