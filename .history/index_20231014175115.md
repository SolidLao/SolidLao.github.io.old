## Jiale Lao

My name is Jiale Lao, and I'm an undergraduate student from Sichuan University. My academic pursuits predominantly revolve around the fascinating realms of databases, machine learning, large language models, and graph neural networks.

I have the privilege of being mentored by two exceptional figures in the field: Prof. Mingjie Tang from Sichuan University and Prof. Jianguo Wang from Purdue University. Their guidance has been invaluable to my academic journey, offering me the perfect blend of theoretical understanding and practical application.

As I continue to delve deeper into my areas of interest, I look forward to collaborating and engaging with like-minded individuals and professionals. Do feel free to explore my work, share your thoughts, or get in touch!
