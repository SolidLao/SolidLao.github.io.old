## Abstract
Modern database management systems (DBMS) expose hundreds of configurable knobs to control system behaviors. Determining the appropriate values for these knobs to improve DBMS performance is a long-standing problem in the database community. As there is an increasing number of knobs to tune and each knob could be in continuous or categorical values, manual tuning becomes impractical. Recently, automatic tuning systems using machine learning methods have shown great potential. 
However, most existing methods only rely on the runtime feedback of benchmark evaluations to guide the optimization, and ignore the extensive tuning knowledge. Due to the limited and unstable feedback information, they suffer from the increasing complexity of knob tuning problem and still incur significant tuning costs in finding a satisfactory configuration in practice. For the approach that utilizes pre-trained language model for text analysis to enhance the knob tuning process, it only yield sub-optimal performance due to its limited utilization of domain knowledge, and inadequate exploration of the solution space owing to its coarse granularity. Hence, we propose GPTuner, a manual-reading database tuning system that leverages domain knowledge (e.g., semi-structured documents) to both optimize search space and enhance the runtime feedback-based optimization process in knob tuning. GPTuner employs a LLM-based pipeline to extract and handle multi-source knowledge, a prompt ensemble algorithm to transfer the semi-structured knowledge into a structured view, a series of knowledge-based optimizations to optimize the configuration space from two aspects, and a Coarse-to-Fine Bayesian Optimization Framework to explore the optimized space. We evaluate GPTuner under different benchmarks (TPC-C and TPC-H), metrics (throughput and latency) as well as DBMS (PostgreSQL and MySQL). Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, GPTuner finds the best-performing knob configuration with significantly less tuning rounds in all cases.


## System Overview
![GPTuner](/assets/images/gptuner.png)

GPTuner is a manual-reading database tuning system to suggest a satisfactory knob configuration with reduced tuning costs. Above figure presents the tuning workflow and it involves six procedures. ① User provides the DBMS to be tuned (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL), the target workload, and the optimization objective (e.g., latency or throughput). ② \system extracts tuning knowledge from LLM, cleans toxic knowledge and summarize the knowledge from all resources (e.g., GPT-4, DBMS manuals and Web contents). ③ \system transfers the summarized knowledge into a structured format accessible to machines (e.g., JSON). ④  \system prunes the search space in terms of data dimensionality by selecting important knobs to tune. ⑤ \system utilizes the structured knowledge to optimize the space.  ⑥  \system explores the optimized space using a Coarse-to-Fine Bayesian Optimization framework and finally identifies a satisfactory knob configuration within resource limits.
