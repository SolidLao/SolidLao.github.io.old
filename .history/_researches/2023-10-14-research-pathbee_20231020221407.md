## Abstract

Finding shortest paths in large graphs is a fundamental challenge in many applications, such as social network analysis and route navigation in road networks. The current state-of-the-art approaches rely on 2-hop labeling but suffer from two key limitations: long index building time and large index size. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely PathBee, that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve the 2-hop labeling-based approaches and accelerate the processing of shortest-path queries. We conducted extensive experiments on \textbf{26 real datasets} with varying sizes and characteristics to compare \textsc{PathBee} with state-of-the-art approaches. The experiments show that \textsc{PathBee} achieves substantial reductions in index construction time (up to \textbf{21.49 times}), index size (up to \textbf{5.78 times}), as well as query time (up to \textbf{2.18 times}).
