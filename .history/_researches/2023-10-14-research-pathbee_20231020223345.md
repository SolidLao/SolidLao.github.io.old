## Abstract

Finding shortest paths in large graphs is a fundamental challenge in many applications, such as social network analysis and route navigation in road networks. The current state-of-the-art approaches rely on 2-hop labeling but suffer from two key limitations: long index building time and large index size. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely PathBee, that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve the 2-hop labeling-based approaches and accelerate the processing of shortest-path queries. We conducted extensive experiments on **26 real datasets** with varying sizes and characteristics to compare PathBee with state-of-the-art approaches. The experiments show that PathBee achieves substantial reductions in index construction time (up to **21.49 times**), index size (up to **5.78 times**), as well as query time (up to **2.18 times**).

## Overview of PathBee

Our observation is that the *vertex traverse order* in the index construction procedure of the 2-hop labeling-based approaches plays a critical role. However, **we prove that finding the optimal vertex traverse order is an NP-hard problem**. To address this, we propose to order the vertices based on their *centrality values*, drawing inspiration from social networks. As there are a lot of centrality metrics available, **we model the index construction procedure** and find that the Betweenness Centrality (BC) offers the fastest index construction and the smallest index size. However, computing the BC is computational expensive. Therefore, **we propose leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to accelerate the computation of BC**, following the trend of using ML for improving databases. However, despite advances in existing GNNs, they do not match our downstream task (2-hop labeling) and lead to substantial performance degradation. Thus we introduce optimizations in PathBee to address this problem.
Technically, **we develop a novel sampling strategy** that takes into account the distribution characteristic of BC values. Moreover, we observe that the ordering of only the top m% of vertices is crucial, e.g., top 25%. Therefore, **we apply our sampling strategy to enable GNNs to solely determine the ordering of the top m% of vertices**. As a result, when applied PathBee to state-of-the-art 2-hop labelling-based approaches, it can significantly reduce the index building time and index size, while also improving the query performance of answering shortest-path queries.
