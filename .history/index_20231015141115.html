<h2>Jiale Lao</h2>

<p>
    I am a highly motivated and passionate undergraduate from Sichuan University, eager to <strong>pursue admission into a Ph.D. program.</strong> I possess a keen interest in <strong>Database, Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and Graph Neural Networks.</strong> My aim is to make significant contributions to the field through advanced research and collaborative efforts.
</p>


<p>I'm fortunate to be mentored by <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/csjgwang/">Prof. Jianguo Wang</a> from <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a> and <a href="http://merlintang.github.io/">Prof. Mingjie Tang</a> from  <a href="https://www.scu.edu.cn/">Sichuan University</a>. Their expertise has enriched my academic experience, balancing theory with hands-on application.</p>

<p>I'm eager to collaborate with others in my fields of interest. Please explore <a href="">my work</a> share your feedback, or reach out!</p>
